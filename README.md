# endless-stuff
My hub for all of my Endless Sky related content and projects, of which there are quite a few.

# Plugins

## ES Dawn
An old plugin of mine written as a prequel to the main story arch. Incompatible lore-wise with vanilla ES, very buggy, and completely unmaintained for at least a year now. Never completed.  
https://github.com/mOctave/es-dawn  
**Status**: Abandoned, semi-functional

## Blended Ships
My largest "content" plugin, a spliced ships mod where all the ships are made in Blender and are realistic in terms of stats and shortcomings. You won't find any OP ships here, but you will find the Eagle.  
https://github.com/mOctave/blended-ships  
**Status**: In progress, functional

## Eternal Shuttle
A very unfinished plugin in which the player has to fight off an alien invasion in only a shuttle, in a universe where the original First Last never existed.  
https://github.com/mOctave/eternal-shuttle  
**Status**: Abandoned, semi-functional

## Taskship
A plugin which offers jobs only to captains of specific flagship models. Designed as an experimental approach to bring more love to underused ships.
https://github.com/mOctave/taskship
**Status**: In progress, functional

## Minor Plugins

### Toblerone
A plugin featuring what I believe to be the largest ship ever made for ES, far outranking the pitiful Quaernan. Only available in .zip form, this is a finished product and will *not* be updated. I believe all the many bugs to be unavoidable and caused by me pushing the Endless Sky game engine well beyond its limits (most ES ship graphics aren't measured in megapixels).
If you want the original version of the Toblerone plugin with @2x assets, please see the GitHub release called "Large Zips Here".  
**Status**: Finished, unfunctional

### ES Callisto
A small plugin including some minor lore and flavour text and adding Callisto as a landing location in Sol. This is a finished product and will *not* be updated unless there are breaking changes in ES.  
https://github.com/mOctave/es-callisto  
**Status**: Finished, functional

### Moar Humanity
A bit of a dump containing some weird ideas I've had that affect human space.  
https://github.com/mOctave/moar-humanity  
**Status**: Unknown

### Atlantian League
An old, naval-esque plugin of mine adding a new faction to the game in the east of the galaxy. Long abandoned, probably overlaps with Gegno content now. Only available in .zip form.
**Status**: Abandoned, semi-functional

### Azenezon
A plugin I abandoned before I truly started on it, featuring one small, high-tier ship available with the all-content plugin. Only available in .zip form.
**Status**: Abandoned, functional

### US Election Maps
A joke plugin I put together that nonetheless functions as a practical tool for viewing American historical election maps as far back as 2004. I'm not sure that the 2000 one is correct. Only available in .zip form.
**Status**: Abandoned, semi-functional

### Greymatter Tribes
One of my better pieces of early, incomplete garbage, this plugin provides some (completely unrealistic and uninformed) backstory to the Drak, as well as a new one-system faction called the Eliminators who are bent on conquering human space. Only available in .zip form: see the release called "Large Zips Here".  
**Status**: Abandoned, semi-functional

# My Forks

I have forks of most of the main ES repositories, as well as some others. I'll include the links here, but not the repos (they should be self-evident).

# The Searchers

Most Searcher development is happening on Discord as of now. To join my server, use this link: https://discord.gg/j6KqfFBsSp  
The new lore document is available at https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XA7ylaV3JeJ4EdZtHXq5NjFSPyii1s5L2wJ5wdguuVY/edit?usp=sharing  
I have now migrated Searchers content off of my fork and over to https://github.com/mOctave/searchers, in plugin format.  
I'm continuing to aim for vanilla.

# Map Stuff

I am currently working on a Endless Sky map generator. It's up and running at https://github.com/mOctave/mapgen, and mostly functional, although there's still some bugs that need smoothing out. I plan to use the map generator to publish all future versions of the Endless Sky Map.

Speaking of the map, the latest public version remains 0.10.5. Spoilers are not included. Feel free to distribute it however you wish as long as you do not remove the watermark. This map, along with others, is available in the `maps` directory.

# Meteor Missile Cutaway

This is my interpretation of the internal workings of the Meteor Missile as of the year 2793. This work is licensed under a CC-BY-SA-4.0 license, and was derived from works by Becca Tommaso and Michael Zahniser. Feel free to use as you wish as long as you provide credit where credit is due.

# Other Things

I recently wrote a Python script to analyze data files for mission completion and report back. It is free for anyone to use and adapt, but please give credit (even if informally) if you share it or a modified version of it.

## Spreadsheets

Some while ago, I had an idea to create a high-quality set of data sheets for both vanilla and alien content. It is outdated but fairly reliable for vanilla content from November 2022, and I abandoned it when I realized the difficulties in figuring out trivia like ship manufacturers for plugin content, but if you want it it's available at https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1OAz5Iw9k-U2T6uEGj2FA5dMpE-VLJ4ekm80Z7IdDi8M/edit?usp=sharing.

Here is my relative ship abundance spreadsheet, accurate as of version 0.10.4: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P05nS0vKUA0khCnKQC-WIQZ2guYL6aVwb48x9_skGZU/edit?usp=sharing. Ship abundances are calculated based on natural fleet spawns at the beginning of the game. If you want the code I used to calculate all this, you can find it under ShipCountCalculator.java. A compiled version is not available, you willl have to compile and run it using `javac ShipCountCalculator.java` and `java ShipCountCalculator`.

Here is a spreadsheet of current (last updated 0.10.10) planet and system attributes and the planets and systems that use them: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YsAR1AsyE9rEWZF6UvupnSHVAMKNxaMm87tHucDXdzM/edit?usp=sharing.

## Ship Comparisons

Last year, I put together a now outdated booklet of ES ship comparisons. If you want it, it's [here](https://github.com/mOctave/endless-stuff/blob/main/ES%20Ship%20Comparisons.pdf).
